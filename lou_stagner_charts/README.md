* The stimp is in the upper left corner
* Percent slope across the top
* Distance to the hole (in feet) down the left hand side
* Boxes that are grey in color means the target line is INSIDE the hole and that many inches from the edge. For example, in the first chart below, if you are 4 feet from the hole and the slope is 0.5%, your start line would be one inch INSIDE the hole.
* Boxes that are white in color means the target line is OUTSIDE the hole and that many inches from the edge. For example, in the first chart below, if you are 8 feet from the hole and it is a 2% slope, your start line would be 6 inches OUTSIDE the edge of the hole.
